    "  - Provide a brief description of the input language you designed for your interpreter.  \n",
    "  - Explain the inspiration or rationale behind the design of this language. What kinds of problems does it solve?  \n",
    "  - Describe the structure of the input language in detail:  \n",
    "    - What tokens (keywords, symbols, or operators) are recognized?  \n",
    "    - What is the grammar or syntax of valid commands?  \n",

    "  - Give examples of valid and invalid inputs and explain how your interpreter responds in each case.  \n",
