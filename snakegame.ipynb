    "# Section 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An **interpreter system**, in general, is a type of program that reads and executes instructions directly. It translates high-level instructions line-by-line into machine code, a code that the computer recognizes and executes (GeeksForGeeks, 2025). Interpreters have contributed significantly in the field of software development, unlike compilers, which take whole batches of source code and transform them into machine code before executing, interpreters read the instructions per line or per statement at runtime, which allows a more flexible and faster approach to problem-solving and decision-making (Zohuri et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we created a snake game interpreter. It is a graphics interpreter with our very own twist of transforming it into a fully-functioning game, complete with UI design, objectives, levels, and Quality of Life functions such as saving and loading previously-made user instructions. This is our attempt at both showing the learning outcomes of our course, \"Principles of Programming Languages\", where we were enlightened about what a lexer, parser, and executor are, and mimicking modern games and systems running primarily on user inputs. We took inspiration from an existing mobile game called \"Human Resource Machine\" which is a programming game where pieces of instructions are provided by the game to the players and their task is to deliver boxes or data from inbox to outbox while satisfying the needs of the memory cells."

    "# Section 2. Input Language Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed a simple input language for the snake game interpreter. First, there is the MOVE opcode with the parameters of direction and integer. The direction parameter takes 4 directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, while the integer parameter takes any integer value. Executing it will allow the snake object to move to a direction an integer amount of times before stopping and awaiting the next instruction. Second, the EAT opcode has no parameters and is intended as a function/feature that allows the snake to consume the apple object and grow longer by 1 tile. Last, the opcodes LOOP and ENDLOOP enables looping of lines of code any amount of times to achieve the maximum lines allowed per level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We came up with this language as observing how a snake game behaves, these are the only set of moves commonly seen. The eat function was intentionally added in order to make the game have a separate feature other than moving and looping the actions of the snake. These decisions solved all our problems in designing an intuitive game for this project as the move opcode demonstrates an action with varying results through its arguments, the eat with its standalone integration, and the looping as another layer of complexity within our interpreter system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, the tokens are:\n",
    "- `MOVE` keyword\n",
    "- `EAT` keyword\n",
    "- `LOOP` keyword\n",
    "- `ENDLOOP` keyword\n",
    "- Direction literals: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`\n",
    "- Integer literals: positive integers for steps or loop counts\n",
    "- Special symbols: newline (`\\n`) separates commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar rules that the snake game interpreter follows are as follows:\n",
    "- `<command> ::= MOVE <direction> <int>`\n",
    "- `           | EAT`\n",
    "- `           | LOOP <int>`\n",
    "- `           | ENDLOOP`\n",
    "- `<direction> ::= UP | DOWN | LEFT | RIGHT`\n",
    "- `<int> ::= [1-9][0-9]*`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "**Valid Input:**\n",
    "MOVE RIGHT 3\n",
    "MOVE UP 2\n",
    "EAT\n",
    "LOOP\n",
    "MOVE LEFT 1\n",
    "ENDLOOP\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid Input:**\n",
    "MOVE SIDEWAYS 2 # invalid direction\n",
    "MOV RIGHT 3 # typo in opcode\n",
    "EAT NOW # unexpected argument\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter's responses to valid inputs and their outputs is as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MOVE <DIRECTION> <INT>`  \n",
    "  - Action: The interpreter executes a sequence of movement steps in the given direction. Each step calls the Snake movement function (e.g., `self.direction[direction]()`).  \n",
    "  - Output / UI effect: Snake position changes on the Pygame canvas. In Script Mode the whole MOVE executes and updates visually; in Shell Mode the MOVE is posted as a `MOVE_EVENT` and the Pygame event loop animates the steps. No messagebox on success.\n",
    "  - Example: `MOVE RIGHT 3` → snake moves right 3 cells; if all steps succeed there is no error shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EAT`  \n",
    "  - Action: Calls `self.snake.eat(self.foods)` which attempts to remove a food that coincides with the snake head.  \n",
    "  - Output / UI effect: If successful, the food is removed and the snake grows; the canvas reflects the updated state. If unsuccessful, a runtime error is raised (see Section 4).\n",
    "  - Example: `EAT` at a cell containing food → food disappears and snake grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LOOP <INT>` ... `ENDLOOP`  \n",
    "  - Action: All commands between `LOOP n` and `ENDLOOP` are executed `n` times. The interpreter uses a loop stack to track start positions and remaining iterations. Nested loops are allowed.  \n",
    "  - Output / UI effect: Repeated movements / eats are carried out; canvas updates accordingly. In Shell Mode the interpreter accumulates loop lines typed in the shell until an `ENDLOOP` is received, then it parses and executes the whole block.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    LOOP 2\n",
    "      MOVE UP 1\n",
    "      MOVE LEFT 1\n",
    "    ENDLOOP\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    → Up+Left repeated twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shell Mode vs Script Mode behavior\n",
    "- **Script Mode**: `load_program()` reads the entire multiline text and `execute_program()` runs the program start-to-end synchronously (with `sleep(0.5)` between steps so the animation is visible). Any raised exceptions will be displayed with a message box and the game state is reset.\n",
    "- **Shell Mode**: Each user-entered instruction triggers a `SHELL_EVENT`. Single-line commands are executed immediately. If a `LOOP` line is typed, lines are collected until `ENDLOOP` is received; the whole block is then validated and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example valid input → visible output mapping\n",
    "| Input | Action | Visible Output |\n",
    "|-------|--------|----------------|\n",
    "| `MOVE UP 1` | Snake moves up one cell | Canvas updated; no messagebox |\n",
    "| `EAT` (on food) | Snake eats food and grows | Food removed from canvas, snake longer |\n",
    "| `LOOP 3` ... `ENDLOOP` | Body repeated 3× | Canvas animates repeated actions |"

    "The architecture of our snake game interpreter follows the resource provided at the beginning of this project's instructions about \"Making a Programming Language & Interpreter\" in terms of the format and some of the behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For the lexer or tokenizer, we designed it to read the instructions from the game's terminal line by line regardless if it was in SHELL mode or SCRIPT mode. They are then broken up into meaningful tokens like keywords (MOVE, EAT, LOOP, ENDLOOP), direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), and integers. \n",

    "\n",
    "- For the executor, it is closely embedded with the game logic. It executes the parsed instructions one by one and performs most of the exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of our diagram is as follows:\n",
    "INPUT -> TOKENIZER -> PARSER -> EXECUTOR -> OUTPUT\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategies in handling errors are: the snake interpreter uses staged error detection (lexical → syntax → runtime) and clear recovery/reporting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Lexical / basic validation (during `load_program`)\n",
    "- **When:** `load_program()` splits lines and checks basic token forms (it uppercases opcode, checks for labels).  \n",
    "- **Detected problems:** Unknown opcode token (not MOVE/EAT/LOOP/ENDLOOP/label), blank/empty lines are ignored.  \n",
    "- **Response:** `load_program` currently appends tokens and defers detailed validation to execution. If you add stricter lexical checks, raise `SyntaxError` with a message like `Invalid opcode 'FOO' at line X`. The UI should present this via `messagebox.showerror` and not start execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Syntax errors (during `execute_program` startup and at runtime when reading each instruction)\n",
    "- **When:** Immediately before executing a step in `execute_program()` the code verifies the opcode and argument counts (lines like `if len(parts) != 3: raise SyntaxError(...)`).  \n",
    "- **Detected problems:**\n",
    "  - `MOVE` with wrong number of arguments\n",
    "  - `LOOP` with missing or non-integer count\n",
    "  - `ENDLOOP` without a matching `LOOP` (checked via `loop_stack`)\n",
    "  - Unknown opcode\n",
    "- **Response:** The method raises `SyntaxError` with a descriptive message containing the failing line number. The caller (`run_time_thread` or the main loop) catches this and shows it to the user via `messagebox.showerror(\"Syntax Error occured!\", e.msg)`. After this, the game state is reset by calling `generate_snake()` and `generate_food()`.\n",
    "- **Recovery:** Interpreter aborts the current run (no partially applied program state is kept). The user can fix the script and re-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Runtime errors (during execution of MOVE or EAT)\n",
    "- **When:** While applying `MOVE` steps or performing `EAT`.\n",
    "- **Detected problems:**\n",
    "  - Attempting to move into an obstacle or wall (the direction function returns `False`)\n",
    "  - Attempting to `EAT` when no food exists at the head\n",
    "  - Non-positive loop counts or step values (the code checks for positive integers; invalid values should raise `RuntimeError` or `SyntaxError` before execution)\n",
    "- **Response:** The executor raises `RuntimeError` with context (for example `\"You cannot move over an obstacle (x, y)\"` or `\"There's no food to eat at position ...\"`). `run_time_thread` catches the exception and calls `messagebox.showerror(\"Runtime Error occured!\", e.args[0])`. The game state is reset (snake regenerated, food regenerated).\n",
    "- **Recovery:** Abort current run; reset board to pre-run configuration. The user can fix input and re-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Safety guards\n",
    "- **Max steps / loop guard:** To prevent runaway programs (very large loop counts), a guard (e.g., `max_total_steps`) may be used in the executor to abort execution with `ExecError`/`RuntimeError` if too many total steps would be executed. This is a defensive measure against accidental infinite loops or extremely long runs.\n",
    "- **Thread safety:** Execution happens in a background `Thread`. Exceptions are marshalled back to the main thread via the `run_time_thread`'s `try/except` and shown with `messagebox`. The main event loop is not blocked; UI remains responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. UI reporting and user feedback\n",
    "- **Synchronous errors (Shell mode):** Per-line syntax errors are shown as soon as the line is loaded/validated; the shell does not execute the faulty line.\n",
    "- **Batch errors (Script mode):** The whole script is tokenized/validated then executed. On first error, a messagebox pops up with the error text and the interpreter resets the level.\n",
    "- **Non-fatal logging:** Terminal panel (your `Terminal` UI) can be used to print success/trace messages (e.g., `\"Moved RIGHT 3\"`, `\"EAT OK\"`) for debugging. The code already prints some debug info — extend the terminal to show logs if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Example error response mapping\n",
    "| Problem | Exception raised | Where shown | Recovery action |\n",
    "|---------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| `MOVE UP` (missing int) | `SyntaxError(\"Invalid MOVE syntax at line X\")` | messagebox | Reset snake/food; user edits script |\n",
    "| `ENDLOOP` alone | `SyntaxError(\"ENDLOOP found without LOOP at line X\")` | messagebox | Reset snake/food |\n",
    "| `MOVE RIGHT 5` into wall | `RuntimeError(\"You cannot move over an obstacle ...\")` | messagebox | Reset snake/food |\n",

    "\n",
    "This project has been very fun to work on. It was helpful in teaching us how to visualize and create our own interpreter and language, the parts each one have, how to design and build a snake game, how to combine the two concepts, and when to apply the logic for making the two work. Initially, we believed our program to be too simple because we thought of its move set as too simple. This was when we realize that we can make it more challenging by including another opcode and then fully realizing the graphics interpreter into a game with its own objectives, levels, and design. We were successful in implementing and combining both and we are confident that we showcased the outcomes of each section and provided sufficient resources to prove our claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is strong in the following fields:\n",
    "- Simple opcode design\n",
    "- Straight-forward error handling\n",
    "- Interactive and visual feedback through PyGame and tkinter\n",
    "- Multiple level designs that explores our interpreter and game logic in-depth\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is limited by the following:\n",
    "- Simple grid (no GUI)\n",
    "- Fixed fruit positions (can be improved with randomness)\n",
    "- Simple UI design\n",
    "- Small number of available opcodes\n",
    "- Simple game interaction mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "For future improvements, aside from going past beyond the limitations as priority, the project can also significantly benefit by:\n",
    "- Adding more features in the available opcodes\n",
    "- Adding more simulation features for playing and replaying\n",
    "- Adding more levels"

    "Resources: You may refer to the following videos as guide: • Making a Programming Language & Interpreter (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3gTw1ZkeK0) • A Compiler For Our Own Programming Language (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsCWivTeFpY) Specifications: You are tasked to design and implement a working interpreter system. In layman’s terms, an interpreter is like a translator for computers: it reads instructions written in a simple language that you design and executes them step by step, immediately producing results. For example, a command interpreter can process inputs such as “/roll dice” to simulate a dice roll; a graphics interpreter can follow instructions such as “move 10, turn 90” to draw a shape; and a rule interpreter can apply business logic like “if amount > 1000 then discount = 10.” The interpreter that you will create should be able to accept user-defined input commands, perform lexical analysis (tokenization), parse the commands according to defined rules, and execute them correctly. It should also handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing appropriate error messages instead of crashing, and it must generate outputs immediately after processing the commands. Each group will select the type of interpreter system they wish to build. Suggested projects include a rule engine, a graphics or drawing interpreter, or a command shell. However, you are not limited to these examples: you are free to design and implement another type of interpreter system of your choice, provided that it demonstrates the essential components of an interpreter (tokenization, parsing, execution, and error handling). You are also encouraged to extend the functionality of your chosen system by adding new features beyond the basic requirements once the core interpreter is working correctly. Deliverables: Submit a zip file containing the source code files via Blackboard. All interpreter components— including the lexer, parser, executor, and error handling—should be implemented in Python 3 and integrated into the Jupyter Notebook. The Notebook must demonstrate the design, implementation, and testing of the interpreter in a clear and reproducible manner. Any additional code or supporting files used in the project, aside from those shown in the Notebook, must also be included in the submission. The zip file must contain the following: • Jupyter Notebook file – ipynb file • Other Python files – py files • Input script/test files – txt or other formats Outline for the Notebook: • Section 1. Introduction to the Problem/Task and Interpreter System • Each group should begin with an introduction that explains what an interpreter system is in general and why it is important. The introduction must also clearly state the specific interpreter system chosen by the group (e.g., command interpreter, rule engine, graphics interpreter). The description should highlight its real-world applications and justify why this project was selected. • The target task of the interpreter should be clearly defined (e.g., executing commands, evaluating rules, or processing structured input). • Section 2. Description of the Input Language • In this section of the notebook, you must fulfill the following: • Provide a brief description of the input language you designed for your interpreter. • Explain the inspiration or rationale behind the design of this language. What kinds of problems does it solve? • Describe the structure of the input language in detail: • What tokens (keywords, symbols, or operators) are recognized? • What is the grammar or syntax of valid commands? • What rules govern valid and invalid statements? • Give examples of valid and invalid inputs and explain how your interpreter responds in each case. • The goal is to make the input language specification clear and understandable without requiring the reader to reference external sources. • Section 3. System Design • List all the Python libraries and modules that you used to build your interpreter. Separate built-in libraries (e.g., re, sys) from third-party libraries (if any were used). • Section 4. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning • Describe the overall architecture of your interpreter. In this section, you must include the following: • An overview of the three main components: Lexer (Tokenizer), Parser, and Executor (Interpreter Engine). • A diagram or structured explanation of how data flows from input → tokenization → parsing → execution → output. • Details about error handling strategies (e.g., syntax errors, runtime errors, invalid inputs). • Justification for your design decisions. Why did you choose a particular parsing method? Why did you structure the interpreter this way? • Section 5. Implementation Details • Provide and explain the implementation of your interpreter step by step. Show the source code for each component: • Lexer: how tokens are identified and categorized. • Parser: how the structure of the commands is validated. • Executor: how the commands are executed. • Error handling: how the system responds to invalid inputs. • Each code block should be accompanied by an explanation. • Section 6. Testing with Valid and Invalid Inputs • Demonstrate how your interpreter works by running a variety of test cases. • Show valid commands and their outputs. • Show invalid commands and the corresponding error messages. • Discuss how these test cases prove the correctness and robustness of your interpreter. • Section 7. Extensions and Additional Features • Document any features added beyond the basic requirements. Examples include: • Support for variables. • Conditionals (if, else). • Loops (while, repeat). • Custom commands. • Explain how these extensions improve the usefulness of your interpreter. • Section 8. Insights and Conclusions • Summarize what your group learned about building an interpreter system. Discuss the strengths and limitations of your interpreter and suggest areas for future improvement. \n",

    "So we came up with a snake game where it moves in four direction and to finish, it must eat the fruit on a rectangle grid of varying sizes, avoid running into walls or to self, and reach the finish point at the edge of the map. Its opcodes are move [direction] [integer], Eat (worm's mouth needs to be on the square where apple is then the eat opcode is stated), and there is a loop functionality where code can jump to other blocks of code. this is our notes: Opcodes: Move [dir] [int] Eat Loop (shortest lines) 1st level: move and error handling (eat, move, placement, invalid inputs) (interpreter) (walls) 2nd level: error handling (holes) 3rd level: (gates) 4th level: 1 loop 5th level: 2 loops.

    "This section presents the full implementation of the interpreter, organized according to its three major components: the lexer (tokenizer), the parser, and the executor. Each component is shown with code excerpts and accompanying explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.1 Lexer (Tokenizer)\n",
    "\n",
    "The lexer processes each line of the user program and breaks it into meaningful tokens such as keywords, directions, and integers. In this project, tokenization is embedded inside the load_program() method of the Game class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code: Tokenization Logic\n",
    "def load_program(self, lines):\n",
    "    self.program = []\n",
    "    self.labels = {}\n",
    "    token_counter = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    for line in lines:\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The code removes blank lines and comments, splits each line into tokens, and classifies each token based on its role. Labels ending with a colon are stored separately to support jumping inside loops. All other statements are appended into the program list. This simple tokenizer design is sufficient because the language grammar is small, and commands follow a predictable structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2 Parser\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser validates the sequence of tokens produced by the lexer. Parsing is not implemented as a separate class; instead, the interpreter performs syntax checking inside the execution loop. This approach was selected because the command set is small and the structure is easy to validate using inline checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code: Syntax Validation within Executor\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser checks the number of arguments for each instruction. For MOVE, it requires exactly three tokens. LOOP must have a count parameter, and ENDLOOP must have a corresponding LOOP in the stack. Unknown keywords immediately raise a syntax error. This straightforward, rule-based approach ensures user programs follow the correct grammar without needing a complex parsing engine.\n",

    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The executor is structured so that each opcode maps to a specific behavior. MOVE calls the internal movement functions of the snake and handles animation timing. EAT removes food from the grid. LOOP and ENDLOOP are implemented using a stack, which is a natural and simple method for tracking nested loops. Any invalid operations (such as moving into walls or eating nonexistent food) immediately raise runtime errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "This subsection documents how different valid statements affect the game and what the user sees in the UI / terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of command effects\n",
    "- `MOVE <DIRECTION> <INT>`  \n",
    "  - Action: The interpreter executes a sequence of movement steps in the given direction. Each step calls the Snake movement function (e.g., `self.direction[direction]()`).  \n",
    "  - Output / UI effect: Snake position changes on the Pygame canvas. In Script Mode the whole MOVE executes and updates visually; in Shell Mode the MOVE is posted as a `MOVE_EVENT` and the Pygame event loop animates the steps. No messagebox on success.\n",
    "  - Example: `MOVE RIGHT 3` → snake moves right 3 cells; if all steps succeed there is no error shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EAT`  \n",
    "  - Action: Calls `self.snake.eat(self.foods)` which attempts to remove a food that coincides with the snake head.  \n",
    "  - Output / UI effect: If successful, the food is removed and the snake grows; the canvas reflects the updated state. If unsuccessful, a runtime error is raised (see Section 4).\n",
    "  - Example: `EAT` at a cell containing food → food disappears and snake grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LOOP <INT>` ... `ENDLOOP`  \n",
    "  - Action: All commands between `LOOP n` and `ENDLOOP` are executed `n` times. The interpreter uses a loop stack to track start positions and remaining iterations. Nested loops are allowed.  \n",
    "  - Output / UI effect: Repeated movements / eats are carried out; canvas updates accordingly. In Shell Mode the interpreter accumulates loop lines typed in the shell until an `ENDLOOP` is received, then it parses and executes the whole block.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    LOOP 2\n",
    "      MOVE UP 1\n",
    "      MOVE LEFT 1\n",
    "    ENDLOOP\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    → Up+Left repeated twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shell Mode vs Script Mode behavior\n",
    "- **Script Mode**: `load_program()` reads the entire multiline text and `execute_program()` runs the program start-to-end synchronously (with `sleep(0.5)` between steps so the animation is visible). Any raised exceptions will be displayed with a message box and the game state is reset.\n",
    "- **Shell Mode**: Each user-entered instruction triggers a `SHELL_EVENT`. Single-line commands are executed immediately. If a `LOOP` line is typed, lines are collected until `ENDLOOP` is received; the whole block is then validated and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example valid input → visible output mapping\n",
    "| Input | Action | Visible Output |\n",
    "|-------|--------|----------------|\n",
    "| `MOVE UP 1` | Snake moves up one cell | Canvas updated; no messagebox |\n",
    "| `EAT` (on food) | Snake eats food and grows | Food removed from canvas, snake longer |\n",
    "| `LOOP 3` ... `ENDLOOP` | Body repeated 3× | Canvas animates repeated actions |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 4 — Error-handling strategies (detailed)\n",
    "### Section 4.3 — Error handling strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter uses staged error detection (lexical → syntax → runtime) and clear recovery/reporting behavior. The following lists where errors are detected, how they are reported to the user, and how the system recovers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Lexical / basic validation (during `load_program`)\n",
    "- **When:** `load_program()` splits lines and checks basic token forms (it uppercases opcode, checks for labels).  \n",
    "- **Detected problems:** Unknown opcode token (not MOVE/EAT/LOOP/ENDLOOP/label), blank/empty lines are ignored.  \n",
    "- **Response:** `load_program` currently appends tokens and defers detailed validation to execution. If you add stricter lexical checks, raise `SyntaxError` with a message like `Invalid opcode 'FOO' at line X`. The UI should present this via `messagebox.showerror` and not start execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Syntax errors (during `execute_program` startup and at runtime when reading each instruction)\n",
    "- **When:** Immediately before executing a step in `execute_program()` the code verifies the opcode and argument counts (lines like `if len(parts) != 3: raise SyntaxError(...)`).  \n",
    "- **Detected problems:**\n",
    "  - `MOVE` with wrong number of arguments\n",
    "  - `LOOP` with missing or non-integer count\n",
    "  - `ENDLOOP` without a matching `LOOP` (checked via `loop_stack`)\n",
    "  - Unknown opcode\n",
    "- **Response:** The method raises `SyntaxError` with a descriptive message containing the failing line number. The caller (`run_time_thread` or the main loop) catches this and shows it to the user via `messagebox.showerror(\"Syntax Error occured!\", e.msg)`. After this, the game state is reset by calling `generate_snake()` and `generate_food()`.\n",
    "- **Recovery:** Interpreter aborts the current run (no partially applied program state is kept). The user can fix the script and re-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Runtime errors (during execution of MOVE or EAT)\n",
    "- **When:** While applying `MOVE` steps or performing `EAT`.\n",
    "- **Detected problems:**\n",
    "  - Attempting to move into an obstacle or wall (the direction function returns `False`)\n",
    "  - Attempting to `EAT` when no food exists at the head\n",
    "  - Non-positive loop counts or step values (the code checks for positive integers; invalid values should raise `RuntimeError` or `SyntaxError` before execution)\n",
    "- **Response:** The executor raises `RuntimeError` with context (for example `\"You cannot move over an obstacle (x, y)\"` or `\"There's no food to eat at position ...\"`). `run_time_thread` catches the exception and calls `messagebox.showerror(\"Runtime Error occured!\", e.args[0])`. The game state is reset (snake regenerated, food regenerated).\n",
    "- **Recovery:** Abort current run; reset board to pre-run configuration. The user can fix input and re-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Safety guards\n",
    "- **Max steps / loop guard:** To prevent runaway programs (very large loop counts), a guard (e.g., `max_total_steps`) may be used in the executor to abort execution with `ExecError`/`RuntimeError` if too many total steps would be executed. This is a defensive measure against accidental infinite loops or extremely long runs.\n",
    "- **Thread safety:** Execution happens in a background `Thread`. Exceptions are marshalled back to the main thread via the `run_time_thread`'s `try/except` and shown with `messagebox`. The main event loop is not blocked; UI remains responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. UI reporting and user feedback\n",
    "- **Synchronous errors (Shell mode):** Per-line syntax errors are shown as soon as the line is loaded/validated; the shell does not execute the faulty line.\n",
    "- **Batch errors (Script mode):** The whole script is tokenized/validated then executed. On first error, a messagebox pops up with the error text and the interpreter resets the level.\n",
    "- **Non-fatal logging:** Terminal panel (your `Terminal` UI) can be used to print success/trace messages (e.g., `\"Moved RIGHT 3\"`, `\"EAT OK\"`) for debugging. The code already prints some debug info — extend the terminal to show logs if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Example error response mapping\n",
    "| Problem | Exception raised | Where shown | Recovery action |\n",
    "|---------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| `MOVE UP` (missing int) | `SyntaxError(\"Invalid MOVE syntax at line X\")` | messagebox | Reset snake/food; user edits script |\n",
    "| `ENDLOOP` alone | `SyntaxError(\"ENDLOOP found without LOOP at line X\")` | messagebox | Reset snake/food |\n",
    "| `MOVE RIGHT 5` into wall | `RuntimeError(\"You cannot move over an obstacle ...\")` | messagebox | Reset snake/food |\n",
    "| Excessive loops | `RuntimeError(\"Execution aborted: exceeded max_total_steps guard\")` | messagebox | Abort run |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Recommended improvements (optional)\n",
