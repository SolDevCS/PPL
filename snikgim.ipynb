    "# Section 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An **interpreter system** is a type of program that reads and executes instructions directly, translating them line-by-line into actions without first compiling them. It’s like a translator that interprets human-like commands and immediately performs the corresponding behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we designed a **Snake Game Interpreter** — a simple rule-based interpreter that allows the snake to move across a grid, eat fruits, and reach a goal point using a set of defined opcodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why a Snake Interpreter?\n",
    "We selected this project because it combines **logic execution** with **visual behavior**, allowing us to demonstrate lexical analysis, parsing, and command execution in an engaging and understandable way. It also mimics how simple game engines interpret player inputs, which is useful for AI game logic and command-based automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Task\n",
    "The interpreter reads snake movement commands written in our custom scripting language, processes them, executes the movement step-by-step, and displays the updated grid state after each command. The snake must:\n",
    "- Move in four directions (up, down, left, right)\n",
    "- Eat fruits placed on the grid\n",
    "- Avoid colliding with walls or itself\n",
    "- Optionally, use loop instructions for repeated patterns\n"

    "# Section 2. Input Language Description\n",

    "|--------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| `MOVE` | MOVE [direction] [steps] | Moves the snake in the given direction for the given number of steps. |\n",

    "| `LOOP` | LOOP [start_line] [end_line] [count] | Repeats a block of code between two line numbers for the given count. |\n",

    "- `EAT` keyword\n",

    "- Special symbols: newline (`\\n`) separates commands\n",

    "### Grammar Rules:\n",
    "- `<command> ::= MOVE <direction> <int> | EAT | LOOP <start_line> <end_line><int>`\n",

    "- `<int> ::= [1-9][0-9]*`\n",

    "MOVE LEFT 1\n",

    "**Invalid Input:**\n",
    "MOVE SIDEWAYS 2 # invalid direction\n",
    "MOV RIGHT 3 # typo in opcode\n",
    "EAT NOW # unexpected argument\n",
    "\n",
    "When invalid input is detected, the interpreter raises a descriptive error message (e.g., “Invalid direction: SIDEWAYS”)."

    "Resources: You may refer to the following videos as guide: • Making a Programming Language & Interpreter (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3gTw1ZkeK0) • A Compiler For Our Own Programming Language (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsCWivTeFpY) Specifications: You are tasked to design and implement a working interpreter system. In layman’s terms, an interpreter is like a translator for computers: it reads instructions written in a simple language that you design and executes them step by step, immediately producing results. For example, a command interpreter can process inputs such as “/roll dice” to simulate a dice roll; a graphics interpreter can follow instructions such as “move 10, turn 90” to draw a shape; and a rule interpreter can apply business logic like “if amount > 1000 then discount = 10.” The interpreter that you will create should be able to accept user-defined input commands, perform lexical analysis (tokenization), parse the commands according to defined rules, and execute them correctly. It should also handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing appropriate error messages instead of crashing, and it must generate outputs immediately after processing the commands. Each group will select the type of interpreter system they wish to build. Suggested projects include a rule engine, a graphics or drawing interpreter, or a command shell. However, you are not limited to these examples: you are free to design and implement another type of interpreter system of your choice, provided that it demonstrates the essential components of an interpreter (tokenization, parsing, execution, and error handling). You are also encouraged to extend the functionality of your chosen system by adding new features beyond the basic requirements once the core interpreter is working correctly. Deliverables: Submit a zip file containing the source code files via Blackboard. All interpreter components— including the lexer, parser, executor, and error handling—should be implemented in Python 3 and integrated into the Jupyter Notebook. The Notebook must demonstrate the design, implementation, and testing of the interpreter in a clear and reproducible manner. Any additional code or supporting files used in the project, aside from those shown in the Notebook, must also be included in the submission. The zip file must contain the following: • Jupyter Notebook file – ipynb file • Other Python files – py files • Input script/test files – txt or other formats Outline for the Notebook: • Section 1. Introduction to the Problem/Task and Interpreter System • Each group should begin with an introduction that explains what an interpreter system is in general and why it is important. The introduction must also clearly state the specific interpreter system chosen by the group (e.g., command interpreter, rule engine, graphics interpreter). The description should highlight its real-world applications and justify why this project was selected. • The target task of the interpreter should be clearly defined (e.g., executing commands, evaluating rules, or processing structured input). • Section 2. Description of the Input Language • In this section of the notebook, you must fulfill the following: • Provide a brief description of the input language you designed for your interpreter. • Explain the inspiration or rationale behind the design of this language. What kinds of problems does it solve? • Describe the structure of the input language in detail: • What tokens (keywords, symbols, or operators) are recognized? • What is the grammar or syntax of valid commands? • What rules govern valid and invalid statements? • Give examples of valid and invalid inputs and explain how your interpreter responds in each case. • The goal is to make the input language specification clear and understandable without requiring the reader to reference external sources. • Section 3. System Design • List all the Python libraries and modules that you used to build your interpreter. Separate built-in libraries (e.g., re, sys) from third-party libraries (if any were used). • Section 4. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning • Describe the overall architecture of your interpreter. In this section, you must include the following: • An overview of the three main components: Lexer (Tokenizer), Parser, and Executor (Interpreter Engine). • A diagram or structured explanation of how data flows from input → tokenization → parsing → execution → output. • Details about error handling strategies (e.g., syntax errors, runtime errors, invalid inputs). • Justification for your design decisions. Why did you choose a particular parsing method? Why did you structure the interpreter this way? • Section 5. Implementation Details • Provide and explain the implementation of your interpreter step by step. Show the source code for each component: • Lexer: how tokens are identified and categorized. • Parser: how the structure of the commands is validated. • Executor: how the commands are executed. • Error handling: how the system responds to invalid inputs. • Each code block should be accompanied by an explanation. • Section 6. Testing with Valid and Invalid Inputs • Demonstrate how your interpreter works by running a variety of test cases. • Show valid commands and their outputs. • Show invalid commands and the corresponding error messages. • Discuss how these test cases prove the correctness and robustness of your interpreter. • Section 7. Extensions and Additional Features • Document any features added beyond the basic requirements. Examples include: • Support for variables. • Conditionals (if, else). • Loops (while, repeat). • Custom commands. • Explain how these extensions improve the usefulness of your interpreter. • Section 8. Insights and Conclusions • Summarize what your group learned about building an interpreter system. Discuss the strengths and limitations of your interpreter and suggest areas for future improvement. \n",

    "So we came up with a snake game where it moves in four direction and to finish, it must eat the fruit on a rectangle grid of varying sizes, avoid running into walls or to self, and reach the finish point at the edge of the map. Its opcodes are move [direction] [integer], Eat (worm's mouth needs to be on the square where apple is then the eat opcode is stated), and there is a loop functionality where code can jump to other blocks of code. this is our notes: Opcodes: Move [dir] [int] Eat Loop (shortest lines) 1st level: move and error handling (eat, move, placement, invalid inputs) (interpreter) (walls) 2nd level: error handling (holes) 3rd level: (gates) 4th level: 1 loop 5th level: 2 loops.
